# Introduction
This site lists software I personally recommend. Some of them I use regularly. It's split up by platform and mostly [FOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

I'm open for additions so if you want something to be added feel free to open a [Issue](https://github.com/D3SOX/awesome-software/issues) or [Pull request](https://github.com/D3SOX/awesome-software/pulls) 

::: tip
Navigate the site using the *top bar* or *sidebar* if you are on mobile
